# Introduction

## Column2

The Great Recession was a period of economic downturn which was observed from 2007 to 2009.The recession was largely blamed on the real estate market as the great recession started after the bursting of the US housing bubble.The effects of the downturn were observed all over the world.Here we will see the effects in United States of the Great Recession on real estate, macroeconomic factors, financial and capital markets.

One interesting thing regarding the Great Recession was that the causes of the economic crisis could not be blamed on the housing market alone.The interest rates on housing loans were lowered by the government to boost growth in housing sector after a minor recession in 2000.The concept of bundling of mortgage assets ( under Collateral Debt Obligations commonly referred to as CDOs) with other types of financial securities was becoming popular and investment banks started using it to take these bundles of loans from banks and sell them to other big investors in market like pension funds, insurance companies.This allowed the primary banks to give housing loan to subprime borrowers( borrowers with poor credit history) as the banks could pass on the risk of default to the third party to whom they sold subprime mortgage bundled funds.Thus the low interest on housing loans and easy availability of subprime mortgage allowed a huge housing bubble to build up until it finally burst when the subprime borrowers started defaulting on loans.

## Column2

The housing market, macroeconomic,socioeconomic parameters and financial markets spiraled down. Many of these factors are interlinked.The defaulting of subprime mortgages were passed on to the banks and the investors of CDOs(Collateralized Debt Obligations) like pension funds, other institutional investors.The pension funds and institutional investors are also the highest investors in the stock markets.The housing markets and securities crashed. The stock markets crashed.The other financial institutions having investments in mutual funds, debt securities, corporate bonds also crashed.The crashing of stock markets had an impact on corporate profits which decreased the GDP and increased the unemployment.The government bonds yields decreased,and the inflation increased before becoming negative in 2009.The poverty index increased significantly.GDP and Income per person decreased during the Great Recession. The Non performing assets of the commercial banks were at an all time high.The housing rental market had a high vacancy rate.

All these factors combined caused and were the affects of the great recession.
